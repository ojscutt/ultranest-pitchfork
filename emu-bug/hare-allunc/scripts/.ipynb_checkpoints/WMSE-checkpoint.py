    Weighted Mean Squared Error Loss Function for tensorflow neural network
    
    Usage:
        - Define list of weights with len = labels
        - Use weights as arguments - no need to square, this is handled in-function
        - Typical usage - defining target precision on outputs for the network to achieve, weights parameters in loss calculation to force network to focus on parameters with unc >> weight.
